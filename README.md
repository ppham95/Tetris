# Tetris
This project was co-written by TCSS 305 instructors at the University of Washington Tacoma. I was given the model for the Tetris game responsible for basic dimensional and functional behaviors of the blocks. I provided the front-end implementations of the GUI--custom sounds, background, statistics panel, scoring algorithm, and other game features.
